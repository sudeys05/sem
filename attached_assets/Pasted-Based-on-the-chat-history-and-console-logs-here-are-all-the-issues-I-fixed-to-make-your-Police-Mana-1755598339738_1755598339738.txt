Based on the chat history and console logs, here are all the issues I fixed to make your Police Management System app run successfully:

1. Import Structure Issues
Problem: Incorrect imports in server/index.ts that were causing module resolution errors
Fix: Cleaned up imports and removed duplicate/conflicting imports like mongoose and unnecessary modules
2. Server Configuration
Problem: Overly complex server setup with redundant middleware and connection logic
Fix: Streamlined the server configuration in index.ts to focus on essential middleware only:
CORS configuration
JSON/URL encoding middleware
Session configuration
MongoDB connection
Route registration
3. MongoDB Connection Flow
Problem: Complex connection logic with mongoose and native MongoDB driver conflicts
Fix: Simplified to use only the MongoDB native driver through your existing connectToMongoDB() function
4. Route Registration
Problem: Circular dependencies and incorrect route imports
Fix: Cleaned up route registration to use only:
registerMongoDBRoutes(app)
registerEvidenceRoutes(app)
Health check endpoint
5. Error Handling
Problem: Poor error handling that wasn't showing the actual issues
Fix: Added proper error logging with stack traces to identify root causes
6. Development vs Production Setup
Problem: Complex conditional logic for development/production
Fix: Simplified to use either Vite dev server or static file serving based on NODE_ENV
7. Session Management
Problem: Duplicate session middleware configuration
Fix: Consolidated session configuration in one place with proper settings
8. File Cleanup
Problem: Syntax error in routes.js with malformed code
Fix: Corrected the malformed line in the OB entries route
The app is now running successfully as shown in your console logs:

✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Server running on port 5000
✅ API endpoints responding (OB entries, evidence, cases all working)
✅ Vite dev server connected
✅ Frontend loading and fetching data from MongoDB
The key was simplifying the overly complex server setup and fixing the import/module resolution issues that were preventing the server from starting.
